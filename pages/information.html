        For absoulutely no reason I made this website. 
        Truthfully, I made it just to learn HTML and CSS 
        and so far I'm pretty confident. 
        That doesn't mean I can make a whole entire 
        fully developed website though... 
        The interior of this website wont be very appealing
        to the average person, but it means alot to 
        me and took a long time. Thank you for 
        viewing my website.

        I made this website with a lot of help with my friend.
        Shoutout to Jack!!
